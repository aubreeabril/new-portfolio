## Portfolio [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aubreeabril/new-portfolio.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aubreeabril/new-portfolio)

Built using Create React App to practice TDD by writing unit tests first and writing components next.

## Getting Started

+ Fork and clone this repository
+ Run `npm install`
+ Edit content with portfolio details.
+ Run tests using `npm test`
+ Create a GitHub access token and add it to [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) as an environment variable.
+ Once the Travis CI dashboard lists your projects, add your projects to Travis using the green switch.
+ Update the .travis.yml file with the name of your own environment variable `github_token: $github_token`

## Future Features

Next I want to add a page for a blog using [ButterCMS](https://buttercms.com/) to request blog posts and a menu.
